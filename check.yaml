Spanning Tree Protocol
----------------------
  - Stp stop the loops which occurs when you have multiple links between  switches
  - stp stops avoiding broadcast storms, multiple frame copies.
  - stp is a open standard [IEEE 802.1D].
  - stp is enabled by default on all cisco catalyst switches.

  how stp works
  -------------
    selecting the root bridge
    selecting the root port
    selecting designated port and non designated port
    Link speed
    10 mbps   100
    100 mbps  19
    1 gbps    4



TCP/IP
IP address
Network and host portion

TCP/IP is a standard Protocol used between
computers and network devices for communication

TCP/IP addressing
-----------------
  ip address is a logical address given to each and every devices in
  Network
  it is a network layer address (layer 3)



  Etherchannel/link aggregation/port-channel
  ------------------------------------------
    - is used to aggregate bandwidth between multiple l2/l3
    interfaces.
    - etherchannel increases bandwidth and provides redundancy
    by aggregating individual links between switches.
    combining multiple links into one logical link.
    - up to 8 links can be used to combine in to one logical links
requirements
-------------
    - same speed
    - same vlan
    we can configure etherchannel either dynamically or manually
    two Protocols used for etherchannel
    -----------------------------------
      - PAGP cisco
      - LACP open standard
